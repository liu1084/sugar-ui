// speech input for inputs
// by @alrra


// `webkitSpeech` in elem
// doesn`t work correctly in all versions of Chromium based browsers.
//   It can return false even if they have support for speech i.imgur.com/2Y40n.png
//  Testing with 'onwebkitspeechchange' seems to fix this problem

// this detect only checks the webkit version because
// the speech attribute is likely to be deprecated in favor of a JavaScript API.
// http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2011OctDec/att-1696/speechapi.html

// FIXME: add support for detecting the new spec'd behavior

Modernizr.addTest('speechinput', function(){
    var elem = document.createElement('input');
    return 'speech' in elem || 'onwebkitspeechchange' in elem;
});
